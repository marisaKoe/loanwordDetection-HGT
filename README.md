# horizontalLanguageTransfer


This program computes the horizontal language transfer described in chapter 5.1.1 in Köllner (2021). The program creates the input files and directly calls the extrnal HGT porgram.

Please note: to run this program you need to download the HGT algorithm from http://www.trex.uqam.ca and add the path to your tree files needed for the computation. The algorithm is based on Boc et al (2010).
